# Jammming React Capstone Project

This is my first project in React. It is a small app where you can search for songs, add to a playlist, name the playlist, and save it into your Spotify account.

You need to login to your Spotify account and grant permission to the app in order for it to work.

You can use a sample of the app at http://erect-twig.surge.sh

Any feedback, and/or suggestions, is welcomed. Thanks.
